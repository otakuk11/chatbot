## 📌 About the Project
This project focuses on evaluating the ergonomic risks faced by tractor drivers using **RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) and REBA (Rapid Entire Body Assessment)**. The approach integrates **CATIA software**, **OpenPose for joint angle estimation**, and a **machine learning-based scoring system** to assess musculoskeletal risks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **dataset of tractor driving postures** using CATIA-generated images.
- **Automate joint angle extraction** using OpenPose.
- Implement **RULA and REBA ergonomic scoring** based on extracted angles.
- Build a **web-based app** for easy data upload and risk assessment visualization.

## 🏆 Key Features
✅ **Automatic posture detection** from CATIA simulations.<br>
✅ **Real-time RULA/REBA scoring** using predefined ergonomic standards.<br>
✅ **Web-based user interface** for seamless interaction.<br>
✅ **Data-driven risk analysis** for ergonomic improvement.<br>

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Libraries:** OpenPose, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask, Streamlit
- **Software & Tools:** CATIA V5, Excel, Web UI Development
